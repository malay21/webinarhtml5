reason behind this file is that i dont wanted to install the webinar app as i am running low on space and RAM <br />

so i just researched and found out that we can use html5 to use GoTowebinar inside the browser <br /><br />

so this is a small bat file which just edits the address and make possible to open in browser<br /><br /><br />

any pull requests are welcomed and i am not a pro just a lazy user so dont hate me :)
